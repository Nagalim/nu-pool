### REQUIRED PARAMETERS ###

# NuBits payout address
address = xxxxxxx

# API key from the exchange
apikey = xxxxxxx

# API secret from the exchange
apisecret = xxxxxxx



### OPTIONAL PARAMETERS ###

# interest: minimal interest rate at which you want to get payouts in percent (0.25% = 0.25).
# Set to 0.001 for pool maximum. You can specify two interest rates for the bid and ask side 
# by separating them with a comma, e.g. 0.25,0.1
interest = 0.001

# ordermatch: place orders even if they would match with an existing order
ordermatch = True

# Parameter Equation:
# offset + deviation + autoshift + manualshift + 0.0005 = server tolerance
###########

# Determines window of allowed price deviation.
# 0.0005 for USD, 0.0015 for fiat, 0.0025 for BTC, 0.005 for CNY
deviation = 0.0025

# How far away from price to place orders. ex: 0.002 is 0.2%, giving 0.4% spread
offset = 0.0055

# Changes the price orders get placed at with respect to the price feed.
# 'Auto' causes a shift based on your buy:sell ratio.
# ex: a 0.002 automatic shift with 75% sell side causes a 0.1% decrease in price
# AutoShift + Exchange Fee < Offset
# 'Manual' can be positive or negative
# ex: a -0.002 manual shift causes a 0.2% decrease in price.
shift = {'auto':0.0,'manual':0.0}

# Maximum volume (positive real), in NBT, of bid and ask orders. Ask is always NBT.
# Use1: Multiple pools on a single exchange fighting over NBT.
# Use2: Not putting all funds in an order at once. 1.5 minimum.
fillamount = {'bid':10000,'ask':10000}

# Sets time (in hours) between bot resets. [bug fixer]
reset_timer = 0.25
