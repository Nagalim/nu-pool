### REQUIRED PARAMETERS ###

# NuBits payout address
address = xxxxxxx

# API key from the exchange
apikey = xxxxxxx

# API secret from the exchange
apisecret = xxxxxxx



### OPTIONAL PARAMETERS ###

# interest: minimal interest rate at which you want to get payouts in percent (0.25% = 0.25).
# Set to 0 for pool maximum. You can specify two interest rates for the bid and ask side 
# by separating them with a comma, e.g. 0.25,0.1
interest = 0

# ordermatch: place orders even if they would match with an existing order
# set this value only to True if you know what you are doing.
ordermatch = True

# Determines window of allowed price deviation
deviation = 0.0025

# Determines market spread
offset = 0.005

# Sets time (in hours) between bot resets. [bug fixer]
reset_timer = 0.5

# Changes the price orders get placed at with respect to the price feed.
# AutoShift + Exchange Fee < Offset
# The above equation is useful to avoid traders taking advantage of you.
# 'Auto' causes a shift based on your buy:sell ratio.
# ex: a 0.002 automatic shift with 75% sell side causes a 0.1% decrease in price
# 'Manual' can be positive or negative
# ex: a -0.002 manual shift causes a 0.2% decrease in price.
shift = {'auto':0.0025,'manual':0.0}

# Maximum volume (positive real), in NBT, of bid and ask orders. Ask is always NBT.
# Use1: Multiple pools on a single exchange fighting over NBT.
# Use2: Not putting all funds in an order at once. 1.5 minimum.
fillamount = {'bid':10000,'ask':10000}
